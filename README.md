# Windshear
Aviation weather site for flight simulation use

This is a personal web development project that began during my private pilot flight training - I wanted a way to easily aggregate
all the weather data that I needed into one place, to supplement proper use of approved aviation weather resources. My aviationbackground, coupled with a long-standing love for flight simulation, resulted in the development of Windshear.

The site is designed for flight simulation. Any information on the site should not be used to make real-world flight
decisions.

Designed using Bootstrap and AVWX REST API.
